# Deep-Learning-image-classification
Deep Learning with Pytorch

The key outcome is that we'll have trained an image classifier which can recognize pet breeds at state of the art accuracy. 

We also discuss how to set the most important hyper-parameter when training neural networks: the learning rate, using Leslie Smith's fantastic learning rate finder method. Finally, we'll look at the important but rarely discussed topic of labeling, and learn about some of the features that fastai provides for allowing you to easily add labels to your images.

The code is based on the wonderful lecture given by Jeremy Howard: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4132&v=XfoYk_Z5AkI
